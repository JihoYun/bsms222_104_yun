# 13 probability
# 13.1 discrete probability

# 13.1.1. relative frequency

A more tangible way to think about the probability of an event is as the proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment an infinite number of times, independently, and under the same conditions.

# 13.1.2 notation

We use the notation  Pr(A)  to denote the probability of event  A  happening.

# 13.1.3 probability distributions

We simply assign a probability to each category. In cases that can be thought of as beads in an urn, for each bead type, their proportion defines the distribution.

# 13.2 monte carlo simulations for categorical data

```{r}
beads<-rep(c('red','blue'),times=c(2,3))
beads
```

```{r}
sample(beads,1)
```
This line of code produces one random outcome

we repeat the experiment a large enough number of times to make the results practically equivalent to repeating forever. This is an example of a Monte Carlo simulation.


To perform our first Monte Carlo simulation, we use the replicate function, which permits us to repeat the same task any number of times. Here, we repeat the random event  
B=  10,000 times:

```{r}
B<-10000
events<-replicate(B,sample(beads,1))
```

```{r}
tab<-table(events)
tab
```
```{r}
prop.table(tab)
```
# 13.2.1 setting the random seed

```{r}
set.seed(1986)
?set.seed
```
# 13.2.2 with and without replacement

```{r}
sample(beads,5)
sample(beads,5)
sample(beads,5)
```
```{r}
sample(beads,6)
```
```{r}
events<-sample(beads,B,replace=TRUE)
prop.table(table(events))
```

# 13.3 independence

We say two events are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the other.

```{r}
x<-sample(beads,5)
```

```{r}
x[2:5]
```

# 13.4 conditional probabilities

When two events, say  A  and  B, are independent, we have:
Pr(A∣B)=Pr(A)
This is the mathematical way of saying: the fact that  B  happened does not affect the probability of  A happening. In fact, this can be considered the mathematical definition of independence.

# 13.5 addition and multiplication rules

# 13.5.1 multiplication rule

If we want to know the probability of two events, say  A and  B , occurring, we can use the multiplication rule:Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)Pr(B∣A)

# 13.5.2 multiplication rule under independence

When we have independent events, then the multiplication rule becomes simpler:

Pr(A and B and C)=Pr(A)Pr(B)Pr(C)

# 13.5.3 addition rule

The addition rule tells us that:

Pr(A or B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B)−Pr(A and B)

# 13.6 combinations and permutations

```{r}
number<-'Three'
suit<-'hearts'
paste(number,suit)
```
paste also works on pairs of vectors performing the operation element-wise:
```{r}
paste(letters[1:5],as.character(1:5))
```
```{r}
expand.grid(pants=c('blue','black'),shirt=c('white','grey','plaid'))

```
```{r}
suits <- c("Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Spades")
numbers <- c("Ace", "Deuce", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", 
             "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
deck <- expand.grid(number=numbers, suit=suits)
deck<-paste(deck$number,deck$suit)
```

```{r}
kings<-paste('King',suits)
mean(deck%in%kings)
```
```{r}
install.packages('gtools')
```
```{r}
library(gtools)
permutations(3,2)
```
Notice that the order matters here: 3,1 is different than 1,3. Also, note that (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) do not appear because once we pick a number, it can’t appear again.

```{r}
all_phone_numbers <- permutations(10, 7, v = 0:9)
n <- nrow(all_phone_numbers)
index <- sample(n, 5)
all_phone_numbers[index,]
```
```{r}
hands<-permutations(52,2,v=deck)
```
```{r}
first_card<-hands[,1]
second_card<-hands[,2]
```
```{r}
kings<-paste('King',suits)
sum(first_card%in%kings)

```
```{r}
sum(first_card%in%kings & second_card%in%kings) / sum(first_card%in%kings)
```
```{r}
mean(first_card%in%kings & second_card%in%kings) / mean(first_card%in%kings)
```
if order does not matter

```{r}
combinations(3,2)
```
```{r}
aces <- paste("Ace", suits)

facecard <- c("King", "Queen", "Jack", "Ten")
facecard <- expand.grid(number = facecard, suit = suits)
facecard <- paste(facecard$number, facecard$suit)

hands <- combinations(52, 2, v = deck)
mean(hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard)
```

```{r}
mean((hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard) |
       (hands[,2] %in% aces & hands[,1] %in% facecard))

```
# 13.6.1 montecarlo example

```

```{r}

  (hands[2] %in% aces & hands[1] %in% facecard)
```
```{r}

  hand<-sample(deck,2)
   (hand[1] %in% aces & hand[2] %in% facecard) | 
    (hand[2] %in% aces & hand[1] %in% facecard)
}
```

}

# 13.9 exercises

1. One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls. What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?.
```{r}
3/15
```
2. What is the probability that the ball will not be cyan?
```{r}
1-0.2
```
3. Instead of taking just one draw, consider taking two draws. You take the second draw without returning the first draw to the box. We call this sampling without replacement. What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
```{r}
0.2*(12/14)
```
4.Now repeat the experiment, but this time, after taking the first draw and recording the color, return it to the box and shake the box. We call this sampling with replacement. What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
```{r}
0.2*0.8
```
5.Two events  A  and  B  are independent if  Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)P(B) . Under which situation are the draws independent?

You don’t replace the draw.
You replace the draw.<-
Neither
Both

6. Say you’ve drawn 5 balls from the box, with replacement, and all have been yellow. What is the probability that the next one is yellow?

```{r}
7/15
```
7.If you roll a 6-sided die six times, what is the probability of not seeing a 6?
```{r}
(5/6)^6
```
8.Two teams, say the Celtics and the Cavs, are playing a seven game series. The Cavs are a better team and have a 60% chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Celtics win at least one game?
```{r}
1-0.6^7
```
9.Create a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm your answer to the previous problem. Use B <- 10000 simulations. Hint: use the following code to generate the results of the first four games:
```{r}
celtic_wins <- sample(c(0,1), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
sum(celtic_wins)
```
The Celtics must win one of these 4 games.
```{r}
B<-10000
result<-replicate(B,sum(sample(c(0,1), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4)))==4)
1-mean(result)
```
10. Two teams, say the Cavs and the Warriors, are playing a seven game championship series. The first to win four games, therefore, wins the series. The teams are equally good so they each have a 50-50 chance of winning each game. If the Cavs lose the first game, what is the probability that they win the series?
```{r}
cavs_wins <- sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
cavs_wins

```
```{r}
22*(0.5^6)
```
11.Confirm the results of the previous question with a Monte Carlo simulation.
```{r}
B<-10000
result<-replicate(B,sum(sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5)))>=4)
mean(result)
```
12.Two teams,  A  and  B , are playing a seven game series. Team  A  is better than team  B  and has a  p>0.5  chance of winning each game. Given a value  p , the probability of winning the series for the underdog team  B  can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation: 
```{r}
prob_win <- function(p){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), 7, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=4
  })
  mean(result)
}
```
Use the function sapply to compute the probability, call it Pr, of winning for p <- seq(0.5, 0.95, 0.025). Then plot the result.
```{r}
p<-seq(0.5,0.95,0.025)
Pr<-sapply(p,prob_win)
Pr
library(tidyverse)
qplot(,Pr)
```
13. Repeat the exercise above, but now keep the probability fixed at p <- 0.75 and compute the probability for different series lengths: best of 1 game, 3 games, 5 games,… Specifically, N <- seq(1, 25, 2). Hint: use this function:
```{r}
prob_win <- function(N, p=0.75){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=(N+1)/2
  })
  mean(result)
}
```
```{r}
N<-seq(1,25,2)
Pr2<-sapply(N,prob_win)
qplot(,Pr2)
```

# 13.11.1 theoretical distributions as approximations

With continuous distributions, the probability of a singular value is not even defined. For example, it does not make sense to ask what is the probability that a normally distributed value is 70. Instead, we define probabilities for intervals. We thus could ask what is the probability that someone is between 69.5 and 70.5.

```{r}
mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)
```
let us see approximation

```{r}
pnorm(68.5, m, s) - pnorm(67.5, m, s) 
pnorm(69.5, m, s) - pnorm(68.5, m, s) 
pnorm(70.5, m, s) - pnorm(69.5, m, s) 
```
```{r}
mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x<=70.1)
```
```{r}
pnorm(70.9, m, s) - pnorm(70.1, m, s)
```
In general, we call this situation discretization. Although the true height distribution is continuous, the reported heights tend to be more common at discrete values, in this case, due to rounding.

# 13.11.2 the probability density

```{r}
1 - pnorm(76, m, s)
```

# 13.12 monte carlo simulations for continous variables


```{r}
n <- length(x)
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
simulated_heights <- rnorm(n, m, s)
```

```{r}
B<-10000
tallest<-replicate(B,{
  simulated_data<-rnorm(800,m,s)
  max(simulated_data)
})
```
```{r}
mean(tallest>=7*12)
```

# 13.13 continuous distributions
R uses a convention that lets us remember the names, namely using the letters d, q, p, and r in front of a shorthand for the distribution. We have already seen the functions dnorm, pnorm, and rnorm for the normal distribution. The functions qnorm gives us the quantiles. We can therefore draw a distribution like this:
```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
qplot(x, f, geom = "line", data = data.frame(x, f = dnorm(x)))
```
the shorthand t is used so the functions are dt for the density, qt for the quantiles, pt for the cumulative distribution function, and rt for Monte Carlo simulation.

# 13.14 exercises

1. Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 5 feet or shorter?
```{r}
pnorm(60,64,3)
```
2. Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 6 feet or taller?
```{r}
1-pnorm(60,64,3)
```
3.Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is between 61 and 67 inches?

```{r}
pnorm(67,64,3)-pnorm(61,64,3)
```
4.Repeat the exercise above, but convert everything to centimeters. That is, multiply every height, including the standard deviation, by 2.54. What is the answer now?
```{r}
pnorm(67*2.54,64*2.54,3*2.54)-pnorm(61*2.54,64*2.54,3*2.54)
```
5. Notice that the answer to the question does not change when you change units. This makes sense since the answer to the question should not be affected by what units we use. In fact, if you look closely, you notice that 61 and 64 are both 1 SD away from the average. Compute the probability that a randomly picked, normally distributed random variable is within 1 SD from the average.
```{r}
pnorm(3,2,1)-pnorm(1,2,1)
```
6. To see the math that explains why the answers to questions 3, 4, and 5 are the same, suppose we have a random variable with average  m  and standard error  s . Suppose we ask the probability of  X  being smaller or equal to  a . Remember that, by definition,  a  is  (a−m)/s  standard deviations  s  away from the average m . The probability is:Pr(X≤a) Now we subtract  μ  to both sides and then divide both sides by  σ :Pr(X−ms≤a−ms)
 
The quantity on the left is a standard normal random variable. It has an average of 0 and a standard error of 1. We will call it  Z :Pr(Z≤a-ms)
So, no matter the units, the probability of  X≤a  is the same as the probability of a standard normal variable being less than  (a-m)/s . If mu is the average and sigma the standard error, which of the following R code would give us the right answer in every situation:

A. mean(X<=a)
B. pnorm((a - m)/s)
C. pnorm((a - m)/s, m, s)
D. pnorm(a)

C

7.Imagine the distribution of male adults is approximately normal with an expected value of 69 and a standard deviation of 3. How tall is the male in the 99th percentile? Hint: use qnorm.

```{r}
qnorm(0.99)*3+69

```

8.The distribution of IQ scores is approximately normally distributed. The average is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. Suppose you want to know the distribution of the highest IQ across all graduating classes if 10,000 people are born each in your school district. Run a Monte Carlo simulation with B=1000 generating 10,000 IQ scores and keeping the highest. Make a histogram.

```{r}

B <- 1000
IQ <- replicate(B, {
  simulated_data <- rnorm(10000, 100, 15)
  max(simulated_data)
})
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot()+geom_histogram(aes(IQ))
```
