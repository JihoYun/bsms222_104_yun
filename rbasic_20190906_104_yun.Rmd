# 3.2 the very basics

# 3.2.1 objects

<- to assign values to the variable

<- and = can be used, but = not recommended

i would like to see values by print() not just the variable
```{r}
a <- 1
b<-1
c<- -1
a
print(a)

```
# 3.2.2 the workspace

ls() to see variables

```{r}

ls()

(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )

```
# 3.2.3 functions

there is built in functions that we can use for ex. log function

if i want to know about certain function, use help or simply ?function.

log function follows order but if using the arguments order does not matter


```{r}
log(8)

log(a)

help('log')
?log

args(log)
log(exp(2))
log(8,base=2)
log(x=8,base=2)
log(8,2)
log(base=2,x=8)
2^3
help("+")
?"+"
help(">")
?">"

```
# 3.2.4 other prebuilt objects

Inf is for infinity

```{r}
data()
co2
pi

Inf+1
```
# 3.2.5 variable names

variable start with a letter

```{r}
solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
solution_1
solution_2 <- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
solution_2

```
# 3.2.6 saving your workspace

rm function is erasing function

# 3.2.7 motivation scripts

By creating and saving a script with the code above, we would not need to retype everything each time and, instead, simply change the variable names

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2
c <- -1
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
```
# 3.2.8 commenting your code

symbol #, it is not evaluated.
```{r}
## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c
## define the variables
a <- 3 
b <- 2
c <- -1

## now compute the solution
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
```
# 3.3 exercise

1. what is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? the formula for the sum of integers 1 through n is (n*(n+1))/2 
```{r}
x=100
(x*(x+1))/2
```
2. use the same formula to compute the sum of the integers from 1 through 1,000
```{r}
x<-1000
(x*(x+1))/2
```
3. look at the result of typing the following code into R
```{r}
n <- 1000
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)
```
A. sum creates a list of numbers and seq adds them up.

B. seq creates a list of numbers and sum adds them up.

C. seq computes the difference between two arguments and sum computes the sum of 1 through 1000.

D. sum always returns the same number.

answer is b

4. in math and programming we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given number. So if we type sqrt(4), we evaluate the sqrt function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. The evaluations happen from the inside out. Use one line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root of 100.
```{r}
log(sqrt(100),base=10)

```
5.which of the following will always return the numeric value stored in x? you can try out examples and use the help system if you want.
A. log(10^x)

B. log10(x^10)

C. log(exp(x))

D. exp(log(x, base = 2))

```{r}
log(10^x)
log10(x^10)
log(exp(x))
exp(log(x, base = 2))
 

```
the answer is c

# 3.4 data types

r class is different from class in python

```{r}
a <- 2
class(a)
```

# 3.5 data frames

 common way of storing a dataset in R is in a data frame.

```{r}

library(dslabs)
data(murders)
class(murders)



```
# 3.5.1 examining an object

str as structure not like string in python

```{r}
str(murders)
?str
head(murders)

```
# 3.5.2 the accessor:$

use $ for access data sets(particular)

to know names use names().

```{r}
murders$population
murders$state

names(murders)

```
# 3.5.3 vectors: numerics, characters, and logical

numeric==real num
integer==integer
as.(function((x))==change x to function

```{r}
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
class(pop)

class(murders$state)

z <- 3 == 2
z
class(z)

?Comparison

class(1)
class(1L)

```
# 3.5.4 factors

FUN	
a function whose first argument is a vector and returns a scalar, to be applied to each subset of X determined by the levels of x.
reorder(x, X, FUN = mean, ...,
        order = is.ordered(x))

northeast=least , south=most
```{r}
class(murders$region)
levels(murders$region)
?reorder
region <- murders$region
value <- murders$total
region <- reorder(region, value, FUN = sum)
levels(region)
```
# 3.5.5 lists

```{r}
record<-list("john Doe",1234,c(95,82,91,97,93),'A')
names(record)<-list('name','student_id','grades','final_grade')

record
class(record)
record$student_id
record[['student_id']]

```
#3.5.6 matrices

mat[2,] returns vector not matrix

mat[a:b,c:d]==a~b and c:d sub matrix

```{r}
mat<- matrix(1:12,4,3)
mat
mat[2,3]
mat[2,]
mat[,3]
mat[,2:3]
mat[1:2,2:3]
as.data.frame(mat)
data("murders")
murders[25,1]
murders[2:3,]
```
# 3.6 exercises

1.Load the US murders dataset.

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

Use the function str to examine the structure of the murders object. We can see that this object is a data frame with 51 rows and five columns. Which of the following best describes the variables represented in this data frame?

A. The 51 states.

B. The murder rates for all 50 states and DC.

C. The state name, the abbreviation of the state name, the state’s region, and the state’s population and total number of murders for 2010.

D. str shows no relevant information.

answer is c

2.What are the column names used by the data frame for these five variables? 

names(murders)

3.Use the accessor $ to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object a. What is the class of this object?
```{r}
a<-murders$abb
class(a)
```
numeric

4.Now use the square brackets to extract the state abbreviations and assign them to the object b. Use the identical function to determine if a and b are the same.
```{r}
b<-murders[,2]
class(b)

identical(a,b)
```
a and b is different b is character

5. We saw that the region column stores a factor. You can corroborate this by typing:

```{r}
class(murders$region)
```

With one line of code, use the function levels and length to determine the number of regions defined by this dataset.

```{r}

length(levels(murders$region))
```
4

6.The function table takes a vector and returns the frequency of each element. You can quickly see how many states are in each region by applying this function. Use this function in one line of code to create a table of states per region.
```{r}
table(murders$region)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
