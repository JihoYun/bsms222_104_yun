# 9 visualizing data distributions
In this Chapter, we first discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights. We then discuss the ggplot2 geometries for these visualizations in Section 9.16.
# 9.1 variable types
We will be working with two types of variables: categorical and numeric. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.

# 9.2 Case study: describing student heights


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
head(heights)
```
# 9.3 Distribution function

```{r}
#> Female   Male 
#>  0.227  0.773

```

# 9.4 Cumulative distribution functions

F(a)=Pr(x≤a)

we can see that 16% of the values are below 65, since  F(66)=0.164, or that 84% of the values are below 72, since  F(72)=0.841, etc.

# 9.5 histograms
CDF= not very popular in practice
 it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values?
 
What information do we lose? Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches.

# 9.6 smoothed density
We therefore make a histogram, using bin sizes appropriate for our data and computing frequencies rather than counts, and we draw a smooth curve that goes through the tops of the histogram bars. 

We should select a degree of smoothness that we can defend as being representative of the underlying data

# 9.6.1 interpreting the y-axis
Note that interpreting the y-axis of a smooth density plot is not straightforward. It is scaled so that the area under the density curve adds up to 1. If you imagine we form a bin with a base 1 unit in length, the y-axis value tells us the proportion of values in that bin. However, this is only true for bins of size 1. For other size intervals, the best way to determine the proportion of data in that interval is by computing the proportion of the total area contained in that interval.

# 9.6.2 densities permit stratification
we point out that an advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities makes it easier to compare two distributions.

A

# 9.8 the normal distribution

The distribution is symmetric, centered at the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average.
```{r}
m<-sum(x)/length(x)
```
and the SD is defined as:
```{r}
s<-sqrt(sum(x-mu)^2)/length(x)
```

```{r}
index<-heights$sex=='Male'
x<-heights$height[index]
```
```{r}
m<-mean(x)
s<-sd(x)
c(average=m,sd=s)

```

# 9.9 standard units

for a value x from a vector X, we define the value of x in standard units as z = (x - m)/s with m and s the average and standard deviation of X respectively

```{r}
z<-scale(x)
z
```

```{r}
mean(abs(z)<2)

```

# 9.10 Quantile-quantile plots

Φ(x)to define the function that gives us the probability of a standard normal distribution being smaller than  x.So,for example,  Φ(−1.96)=0.025  and  Φ(1.96)=0.975 . In R, we can evaluate  Φ
 using the pnorm function:


```{r}
pnorm(-1.96)
pnorm(1.96)
```
The inverse function  Φ−1(x)gives us the theoretical quantiles for the normal distribution. So, for example,  Φ−1(0.975)=1.96. In R, we can evaluate the inverse of  Φ using the qnorm function.
```{r}
qnorm(0.975)
```
```{r}
qnorm(0.975,mean=5,sd=2)
```
```{r}
mean(x<=69.5)
x2<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
mean(x2<=5)
```

```{r}
p<-seq(0.05,0.95,0.05)
```
```{r}
sample_quantiles<-quantile(x,p)
```
```{r}
theoretical_quantiles<-qnorm(p,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
```
```{r}
qplot(theoretical_quantiles,sample_quantiles)+geom_abline()
```

```{r}
sample_quantiles <- quantile(z, p)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p) 
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles) + geom_abline()
```
```{r}
heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()
```

# 9.11 percentiles

Percentiles are special cases of quantiles that are commonly used. The percentiles are the quantiles you obtain when setting the  p at  0.01,0.02,...,0.99. We call, for example, the case of  p=0.25 the 25th percentile, which gives us a number for which 25% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the median.

# 9.12 boxplots

box defined by the 25% and 75% percentile and the whiskers showing the range. The distance between these two is called the interquartile range. The two points are outliers according to Tukey’s definition. The median is shown with a horizontal line

we know that the median is about 2.5, that the distribution is not symmetric, and that the range is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions.

# 9.13 stratification

we divide the height values into groups based on a sex variable: females and males. We call this procedure stratification and refer to the resulting groups as strata.

Stratification is common in data visualization because we are often interested in how the distribution of variables differ across different subgroups. 

# 9.14 case study:describing student heights

```{r}
heights%>%filter(sex=='Female')%>%top_n(5,desc(height))%>%pull(height)
```

# 9.15 exercises

1.Define variables containing the heights of males and females like this:
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
male <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
female <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Female"]
length(male)
length(female)
```
How many measurements do we have for each?

812,238

2.Suppose we can’t make a plot and want to compare the distributions side by side. We can’t just list all the numbers. Instead, we will look at the percentiles. Create a five row table showing female_percentiles and male_percentiles with the 10th, 30th, 50th, …, 90th percentiles for each sex. Then create a data frame with these two as columns.

```{r}
my_summary <- function(dat){
  x <- quantile(dat$height, c(0.1,0.3, 0.5,0.7,0.9))
  tibble('10th' = x[1], '30th' = x[2], '50th' = x[3],'70th' = x[4],'90th'=x[5])
}

femaleandmale<-heights%>%group_by(sex)%>%do(my_summary(.))
femaleandmale
 library(magrittr)
femaleandmale<-femaleandmale %>% t %>% as.data.frame
femaleandmale=femaleandmale[-1,]
names(femaleandmale)<-c('female','male')
femaleandmale
```
3. Study the following boxplots showing population sizes by country:
Which continent has the country with the biggest population size?
Asia

4.What continent has the largest median population size?
Africa

5.What is median population size for Africa to the nearest million?

10

6.What proportion of countries in Europe have populations below 14 million?

A. 0.99

B. 0.75

C. 0.50

D. 0.25

A

7.If we use a log transformation, which continent shown above has the largest interquartile range?
America

8.Load the height data set and create a vector x with just the male heights:
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights$height[heights$sex=="Male"]
```
What proportion of the data is between 69 and 72 inches (taller than 69, but shorter or equal to 72)? Hint: use a logical operator and mean.
```{r}
mean(x>69&x<=72)
```
33%

9.Suppose all you know about the data is the average and the standard deviation. Use the normal approximation to estimate the proportion you just calculated. Hint: start by computing the average and standard deviation. Then use the pnorm function to predict the proportions.
```{r}
ave<-mean(x)
sd=sd(x)

pnorm((72-ave)/sd)
```
10.Notice that the approximation calculated in question two is very close to the exact calculation in the first question. Now perform the same task for more extreme values. Compare the exact calculation and the normal approximation for the interval (79,81]. How many times bigger is the actual proportion than the approximation?

```{r}
mean(x>79&x<=81)
pnorm((81-ave)/sd)
```
8 times

11.Approximate the distribution of adult men in the world as normally distributed with an average of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. Using this approximation, estimate the proportion of adult men that are 7 feet tall or taller, referred to as seven footers. Hint: use the pnorm function.

```{r}
pnorm((84-69)/3)
```
0.0000001%

12.There are about 1 billion men between the ages of 18 and 40 in the world. Use your answer to the previous question to estimate how many of these men (18-40 year olds) are seven feet tall or taller in the world?
```{r}
(1-0.9999997)*10^9
```
300 people

13.There are about 10 National Basketball Association (NBA) players that are 7 feet tall or higher. Using the answer to the previous two questions, what proportion of the world’s 18 to 40 year old seven footers are in the NBA?

```{r}
10/300*100

```
3.33%

14.Repeat the calculations performed in the previous question for Lebron James’ height: 6 feet 8 inches. There are about 150 players that are at least that tall.
```{r}
pnorm((80-69)/3)
(1-0.9998771)*10^9

150/122900*100
```
0.12%

15.In answering the previous questions, we found that it is not at all rare for a seven footer to become an NBA player. What would be a fair critique of our calculations:

A. Practice and talent are what make a great basketball player, not height.

B. The normal approximation is not appropriate for heights.

C. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to underestimate the extreme values. It’s possible that there are more seven footers than we predicted.

D. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to overestimate the extreme values. It’s possible that there are less seven footers than we predicted.

# 9.17 exercises 

1.Now we are going to use the geom_histogram function to make a histogram of the heights in the height data frame. When reading the documentation for this function we see that it requires just one mapping, the values to be used for the histogram. Make a histogram of all the plots.

What is the variable containing the heights?

A. sex

B. heights

C. height

D. heights$height
D

2.Now create a ggplot object using the pipe to assign the heights data to a ggplot object. Assign height to the x values through the aes function.
```{r}
heights%>%ggplot(aes(height))
```
3.Now we are ready to add a layer to actually make the histogram. Use the object created in the previous exercise and the geom_histogram function to make the histogram.
```{r}
heights%>%ggplot(aes(height))+geom_histogram()
```
4.Note that when we run the code in the previous exercise we get the warning: stat_bin() using bins = 30. Pick better value with binwidth.`

Use the binwidth argument to change the histogram made in the previous exercise to use bins of size 1 inch.

```{r}
heights%>%ggplot(aes(height))+geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```
5.Instead of a histogram, we are going to make a smooth density plot. In this case we will not make an object, but instead render the plot with one line of code. Change the geometry in the code previously used to make a smooth density instead of a histogram.

```{r}
qplot(heights$height,geom = 'density')
```
6.Now we are going to make a density plot for males and females separately. We can do this using the group argument. We assign groups via the aesthetic mapping as each point needs to a group before making the calculations needed to estimate a density.

```{r}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, group=sex)) + 
  geom_density() 
```
7.We can also assign groups through the color argument. This has the added benefit that it uses color to distinguish the groups. Change the code above to use color
```{r}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, color=sex)) + 
  geom_density() 
```
8.We can also assign groups through the fill argument. This has the added benefit that it uses colors to distinguish the groups, like this:
```{r}
heights%>%
  ggplot(aes(height,fill=sex))+
  geom_density()
```
However, here the second density is drawn over the other. We can make the curves more visible by using alpha blending to add transparency. Set the alpha parameter to 0.2 in the geom_density function to make this change.
```{r}
heights%>%
  ggplot(aes(height,fill=sex))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)
```
