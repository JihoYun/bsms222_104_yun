This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

# 4 programming basics

note that there are several functions that are widely used to program in R but that we will not cover in this book. These include split, cut, do.call and Reduce. 

# 4.1 conditional expressions

if-else statement->difference from python is conditional statement should be in ()

```{r}
a<-0
if(a!=0){
  print(1/a)
} else{
  print('No reciprocal for 0')
}


library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murder_rate<-murders$total/murders$population*100000

ind<-which.min(murder_rate)
if(murder_rate[ind]<0.5){
  print(murders$state[ind])
}else{
  print('No state has murder rate that low')
}

if(murder_rate[ind]<0.25){
  print(murders$state[ind])
}else{
  print("No state has a murder rate that low.")
}




```
if else takes three arguments: a logical and two possible answers.
If the logical is TRUE, the value in the second argument is returned and if FALSE, the value in the third argument is returned.
```{r}
a<-0
ifelse(a>0,1/a,NA)
```
ifelse can be used in vector by elementwise

```{r}
a <- c(0,1,2,-4,5)
result <- ifelse(a > 0, 1/a, NA)
result

data(na_example)
no_nas<-ifelse(is.na(na_example),0,na_example)
sum(is.na(no_nas))

```

any->vector of logicals and returns TRUE if any of the entries is TRUE
all->vector of logicals and returns TRUE if all of the entries are TRUE
```{r}
z<-c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)
any(z)
all(z)

```
# 4.2 defining functions

making functions

```{r}
avg<-function(x){
  s<-sum(x)
  n<-length(x)
  s/n
}

avg(c(1,2,3,4))
x<-1:100
identical(mean(x),avg(x))

```
as known, variables defined inside a function are not saved
```{r}
s<-3
avg(1:10)
s
```
general form of a function
```{r}
my_function <- function(VARIABLE_NAME){
  perform operations on VARIABLE_NAME and calculate VALUE
  VALUE
}

```
function that computes either the arithmetic or geometric average depending on a user defined variable
```{r}
avg<-function(x,arithmetic=T){
  n<-length(x)
  ifelse(arithmetic,sum(x)/n,prod(x)^(1/n))
}
?prod
avg(sqrt(1:20))
sqrt(1:20)
```
# 4.3 Namespaces

two packages use the same name for two different functions.
We know this becasue when we first load dplyr we see the following message:
```{r}
The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:

    filter, lag

The following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:

    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```
R will follow a certain order when searching for a function in these namespaces
```{r}
install.packages('dplyr')
search()
stats::filter
dplyr::filter
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
