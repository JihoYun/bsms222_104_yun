# 5.7 summarizing data



```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
heights


```

```{r}
s<-heights%>%
  filter(sex=="Female")%>%
  summarize(average=mean(height),standard_deviation=sd(height))
s
```
```{r}
s$average

s$standard_deviation
```
summarize is a data frame

```{r}
x<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
quantile(x,c(0,0.5,1))


heights%>%
  filter(sex=='Female')%>%
  summarize(median=median(height),minimum=min(height),maximum=max(height))
```
```{r}
heights%>%
  filter(sex=='Female')%>%
  summarize(quantile(height,c(0,0.5,1)))
```
```{r}
data(murders)

murders<-murders%>%mutate(rate=total/population*100000)

summarize(murders,mean(rate))
```
```{r}
us_murder_rate<-murders%>%summarize(rate=sum(total)/sum(population)*100000)
us_murder_rate
```
# 5.7.2 pull

```{r}
class(us_murder_rate)
```
as most dplyr functions, summarize always returns a data frame.

```{r}
us_murder_rate%>%pull(rate)
```
```{r}
us_murder_rate<-murders%>%
  summarise(rate=sum(total)/sum(population)*100000)%>%
  pull(rate)
us_murder_rate

class(us_murder_rate)
```
# 5.7.3 group then summarize with group_by

```{r}
heights%>%group_by(sex)


```
```{r}
heights%>%
  group_by(sex)%>%
  summarize(average=mean(height),standard_deviation=sd(height))
```
```{r}
murders%>%
  group_by(region)%>%
  summarize(median_rate=median(rate))
```
# 5.8 sorting data frames

```{r}
murders%>%
  arrange(population)%>%
  head()
```
```{r}
murders %>%
  arrange(rate)%>%
  head()
```
```{r}
murders%>%
  arrange(desc(rate))%>%
  head()
```
# 5.8.1 nested sorting

```{r}
murders %>%
  arrange(region,rate)%>%
  head()
  
```
# 5.8.2 The top n

```{r}
murders%>%
  arrange(-rate)%>%
  top_n(10)
```
```{r}
murders%>%top_n(10,rate)
```
# 5.9 exercises
```{r}
install.packages('NHANES')
```
```{r}
library(NHANES)
data(NHANES)

```
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(na_example)
mean(na_example)
sd(na_example)
```
To ignore the NAs we can use the na.rm argument:
```{r}
mean(na_example,na.rm=TRUE)
sd(na_example,na.rm=TRUE)
```
1.We will provide some basic facts about blood pressure. First let’s select a group to set the standard. We will use 20-29 year old females. AgeDecade is a categorical variable with these ages. Note that the category is coded like " 20-29“, with a space in front! What is the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as saved in the BPSysAve variable? Save it to a variable called ref.

```{r}
head(NHANES)
```
```{r}



ref<-NHANES%>%
  filter(Gender== "female")%>%
  filter(AgeDecade== " 20-29")%>%
  summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE), standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE))
ref

```
2.Using a pipe, assign the average to a numeric variable ref_avg. Hint: Use the code similar to above and then pull.

```{r}
ref_avg<-NHANES%>%
  filter(Gender== "female")%>%
  filter(AgeDecade== " 20-29")%>%
  summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE),standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  pull(average)
            
ref_avg
```
3.Now report the min and max values for the same group.

```{r}
group<-NHANES%>%filter(Gender=='female')%>%filter(AgeDecade==' 20-29')%>%
  summarize(min=min(BPSysAve,na.rm=TRUE),max=max(BPSysAve,na.rm=TRUE))

group



```
4.Compute the average and standard deviation for females, but for each age group separately rather than a selected decade as in question 1. Note that the age groups are defined by AgeDecade. Hint: rather than filtering by age and gender, filter by Gender and then use group_by.

```{r}
group1<-NHANES%>%filter(Gender=='female')%>%group_by(AgeDecade)%>%summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve,na.rm=TRUE),Standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE))

group1



```
5. Repeat exercise 4 for males.

```{r}
groupmen<-NHANES%>%filter(Gender=='male')%>%group_by(AgeDecade)%>%summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE),Standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE))

groupmen
```
6.We can actually combine both summaries for exercises 4 and 5 into one line of code. This is because group_by permits us to group by more than one variable. Obtain one big summary table using group_by(AgeDecade, Gender).

```{r}
groupboth<-NHANES%>%group_by(AgeDecade,Gender)%>%summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE),Standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE))

groupboth
```
7.For males between the ages of 40-49, compare systolic blood pressure across race as reported in the Race1 variable. Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.

```{r}

a<-NHANES%>%filter(Gender=='male')%>%filter(AgeDecade==' 40-49')%>%group_by(Race1)%>%summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve,na.rm = TRUE))%>%arrange((average))


a


```

# 5.10 tibbles

```{r}
data(murders)
class(murders)
```
```{r}
murders%>%group_by(region)%>%head()
```
```{r}
murders%>%group_by(region)%>%class()
```
The functions group_by and summarize always return this type of data frame. The group_by function returns a special kind of tbl, the grouped_df. We will say more about these later.

# 5.10.1 tibbles display better

```{r}
as_tibble(murders)
```

#5.10.2 subsets of tibbles are tibbles

```{r}
murders[,4]
class(murders[,4])
```
```{r}
class(as_tibble(murders)[,4])
```

```{r}
class(as_tibble(murders)$population)
```
```{r}
head(murders)
murders$Population
class(murders)
```
```{r}
as_tibble(murders)$Population
```

# 5.10.3 tibbles can have complex entries

```{r}
tibble(id=c(1,2,3),func=c(mean,median,sd))
```

# 5.10.4 tibbles can be grouped
The function group_by returns a special kind of tibble: a grouped tibble. This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups. The tidyverse functions, in particular the summarize function, are aware of the group information.

# 5.10.5 create a tibble using data_frame instead of data.frame

```{r}
grades<-data.frame(names=c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"),
                   exam_1=c(95,80,90,85),
                   exam_2=c(90,85,85,90))

grades

class(grades)
class(grades$names)




```
```{r}
grades<-data.frame(names=c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"),
                   exam_1=c(95, 80, 90, 85),
                   exam_2=c(90,85,85,90),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

class(grades$names)
```
```{r}
as_tibble(grades)%>%class()
```
# 5.11 the dot operator

```{r}
tab_1<-filter(murders,region=='South')
tab_2<-mutate(tab_1,rate=total/population*10^5)
rates<-tab_2$rate
median(rates)
```
```{r}
filter(murders,region=='South')%>%mutate(rate=total/population*10^5)%>%summarise(median=median(rate))%>%pull(median)
```

```{r}
rates<-filter(murders,region=='South')%>%
  mutate(rate=total/population*10^5)%>%
  .$rate
median(rates)
```

# 5.12 do

The do functions serves as a bridge between R functions such as quantile and the tidyverse. The do function understands grouped tibbles and always returns a data frame.

```{r}
data(heights)
heights%>%
  filter(sex=='Female')%>%
  summarize(range=quantile(height,c(0,0.5,1)))
```
First we have to write a function that fits into the tidyverse approach: that is, it receives a data frame and returns a data frame.

```{r}
my_summary<-function(dat){
  x<-quantile(dat$height,c(0,0.5,1))
  data_frame(min=x[1],median=x[2],max=x[3])
}
```
```{r}

heights%>%
  group_by(sex)%>%
  my_summary
```
```{r}
heights%>%
  group_by(sex)%>%
  do(my_summary(.))
```
```{r}
heights %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  do(my_summary())
```
```{r}
heights%>%
  group_by(sex)%>%
  do(my_summary)
```

# 5.13 the purrr package

```{r}
compute_s_n<-function(n){
  x<-1:n
  sum(x)
}
```

```{r}
n<-1:25

s_n<-sapply(n,compute_s_n)

s_n

```

sapply might convert our result to character under some circumstances. purrr functions will never do this: they will return objects of a specified type or return an error if this is not possible.

```{r}
library(purrr)
s_n<-map(n,compute_s_n)
class(s_n)

```

```{r}
s_n<-map_dbl(n,compute_s_n)
class(s_n)
```
A particularly useful purrr function for interacting with the rest of the tidyverse is map_df, which always returns a tibble data frame. However, the function being called needs to return a vector a or list with names. For this reason, the following code would result in a Argument 1 must have names error:

```{r}
s_n<-map_df(n,compute_s_n)
```
```{r}
compute_s_n<-function(n){
  x<-1:n
  data_frame(sum=sum(x))
  
}
s_n<-map_df(n,compute_s_n)
s_n
```

```{r}
compute_s_n<-function(n){
  x<-1:n
  data_frame(sum=sum(x))
  
}
compute_s_n(n)


data_frame(sum=sum(1:25))
```
# 5.14 tidyverse conditionals

# 5.14.1 case_when

It is similar to ifelse but can output any number of values, as opposed to just TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}
x<-c(-2,-1,0,1,2)
case_when(x<0~'Negative',x>0~'Positive',TRUE~'Zero')
```
```{r}
data(murders)
murders%>%
  mutate(group=case_when(
    abb%in%c("ME", "NH", "VT", "MA", "RI", "CT")~'New England',
    abb%in%c("WA", "OR", "CA")~'West Coast',
    region=='South'~'South',
    TRUE~'other'
  ))%>%
  group_by(group)%>%
  summarize(rate=sum(total)/sum(population)*10^5)%>%
  arrange(rate)
```
# 5.14.2 between

```{r}
x>=a&x<=b
```
```{r}
between(x,a,b)
```
these two operation is same within tidyverse approach

# 5.15 exercises

1.Load the murders dataset. Which of the following is true?

A. murders is in tidy format and is stored in a tibble.

B. murders is in tidy format and is stored in a data frame.

C. murders is not in tidy format and is stored in a tibble.

D. murders is not in tidy format and is stored in a data frame.

```{r}
class(murders)
```
b.

2.Use as_tibble to covert the murders data table into a tibble and save it in an object called murders_tibble.

```{r}
murders_tibble<-as_tibble(murders)
class(murders_tibble)
```

3.Use the group_by function to convert murders into a tibble that is grouped by region.
```{r}
class(murders%>%group_by(region))
```

4.Write tidyverse code that is equivalent to this code: exp(mean(log(murders$population))). Write it using the pipe so that each function is called without arguments. Use the dot operator to access the population. Hint: The code should start with murders %>%.

```{r}
murders%>%.$population%>%log()%>%mean()%>%exp()
```

5. Use the map_df to create a data frame with three columns named n, s_n, and s_n_2. The first column should contain the numbers 1 through 100. The second and third columns should each contain the sum of 1 through  n
with  n the row number.

```{r}
compute_s_n<-function(x){
  n<-x
  n_1<-sum(1:x)
  n_2<-sum(1:x)
  data_frame(n,n_1,n_2)
}

x<-1:100
map_df(x,compute_s_n)
